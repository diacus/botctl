.RE

The most recurrent variable that needs to be set is the access token. In order
to do so, open to the front end of the environment you want to work with with
your web browser and log in. Choose the right front end URL from the list
bellow:

.RS
production   https://bots.wizeline.com
.RE
.RS
staging      https://cms-frontend-staging.bots-platform.com
.RE
.RS
development  https://cms-frontend-development.bots-platform.com
.RE
.RS
local        http://localhost:8000
.RE

Once you have the session started, open your browser's developer tools,
typically by pressing <F12> key; next to the javascript console and copy the
access token using the
.B copy()
javascript function.

.RS
> copy(localStorage.auth_jwt_id)
.RE

That function call copies the value of the access token to your clipboard, once
it's ready, go to the terminal and run the following commands:

.RS
$ botctl chenv ${ENVIRONMENT}
.RE
.RS
$ botctl set token ${THE_ACCESS_TOKEN_STORED_IN_YOUR_CLIPBOARD}
